  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear largely implemented: /admin/access is now wrapped with an owner-only route guard that shows login-required vs access-denied vs the real page, and backend admin-management APIs now enforce an owner-principal check. However, the diff also introduces an unrequested /owner route and includes user-facing copy suggesting Google sign-in, which conflicts with the non-goal of not adding third-party auth providers. There is also a potential behavior change in listAdmins due to a new, non-stable tracking map that may omit pre-existing admins.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Other existing backend APIs and admin functionality behavior remains unchanged.",
      "reason": "The backend now uses a new in-memory `adminPrincipals` map for `listAdmins()` that is only populated on `addAdmin()`. This may change behavior by not listing admins that were already present in `accessControlState` before this tracking was introduced (and it is not shown as stable/persisted).",
