  "summary": "REQ-1 (bootstrap specified principal as admin on install/upgrade without removing existing admins) is not implemented: the new migration does not modify access-control state, and main.mo no longer bootstraps any reserved admin (and the commented principal differs from the requested one). Additionally, project_state.json changes appear unrelated to the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Grant Internet Identity principal `zq4an-uqz34-isqap-u5moy-4rxll-vz3ff-ndqph-gvmn5-hqe6u-o6j3v-yqe` the `#admin` role in backend access-control state, including bootstrapping on fresh install/upgrade when no admins exist, without removing/downgrading existing admins.",
      "reason": "No code in the diff assigns `#admin` to the specified principal during initialization or migration. The added migration function returns state unchanged, and main.mo only contains commented-out bootstrapping for a different principal, explicitly stating bootstrapping is 'handled in migration' (but migration does nothing).",
