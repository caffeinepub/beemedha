  "summary": "Diff implements changes aimed at stopping admin flicker by removing conflicting inline gating (AdminAccessGate now pass-through), stabilizing session validation so it runs once, and adding a safeNavigate helper to prevent repeated same-path navigations. However, the diff also introduces a client-side simulated admin login with hardcoded credentials, which was not requested and conflicts with the stated non-goal of implementing new admin authentication behavior.",

      "description": "Client-side simulated admin authentication with hardcoded username/password, localStorage session issuance/expiry, and comments indicating backend login is not implemented.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on removing conflicting gating/redirect logic to fix flicker and adding a diagnostic safeguard against repeated navigations, and explicitly lists implementing new admin authentication backend as a non-goal. Introducing new auth behavior (hardcoded credentials + session generation) is not requested as part of the flicker fix requirements.",
