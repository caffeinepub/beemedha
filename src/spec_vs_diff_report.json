  "summary": "Frontend routing appears to remove/avoid the Internet Identity-based admin access route, but the diff does not provide enough evidence that the Internet Identity UI/gating was fully removed across the admin area or that the backend admin credential initialization was updated to the specified fixed username/password using the existing hashPassword flow. Some additional admin-guard-related components were modified/introduced without a clear link to the requested changes.",

      "reason": "backend/main.mo is truncated before any admin credential initialization or adminLogin implementation details are shown, so there is no evidence that the fixed username/password was set or that hashPassword is used for storage/verification.",

      "reason": "App routing changes suggest the /admin/access route was removed, but the diff does not show the contents of AdminAccessPage or any admin UI components/guards where Internet Identity prompts or gating might exist. There is also no evidence that the relevant guard logic was updated to rely only on the username/password admin session validation.",
