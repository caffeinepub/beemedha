  "summary": "REQ-1 is partially addressed by adding a GlobalNeonBackground component and mounting it at the root so it appears behind all routes, with a prefers-reduced-motion media query hook. However, the diff summary does not provide evidence of the required CSS behaviors (non-intercepting pointer events, actual animation, reduced-motion behavior implementation, and contrast/legibility safeguards). REQ-2 is partially addressed by adding a reusable DrawerCloseButton and wiring it into multiple Sheet-based drawers, but the diff summary does not show evidence of slide-out close animation behavior or direction-specific slide-out matching the opening side.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Ensure the global animated neon/glow background layers do not intercept clicks/scroll/inputs (pointer events must not be blocked).",
      "reason": "GlobalNeonBackground is added and mounted, but the diff summary does not show any CSS (e.g., pointer-events: none on background layers) or other implementation guaranteeing background layers won't capture interactions.",

      "requirement": "Provide an animated neon/glow background effect site-wide with reduced motion support that disables or significantly reduces motion while retaining neon colors when prefers-reduced-motion is enabled.",
      "reason": "The component toggles a 'reduced-motion' class based on prefers-reduced-motion, but the diff summary does not include the CSS/animation rules that actually animate the background or reduce/disable motion when 'reduced-motion' is present.",

      "requirement": "Clicking the sidebar close (X) must close the sidebar and trigger a slide-out close animation (not an instant disappearance).",
      "reason": "DrawerCloseButton closes by setting Sheet open state false, but the diff summary does not show any animation configuration (e.g., SheetContent animation classes) that ensures a visible slide-out animation on close rather than an instant unmount.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Sidebar slide-out direction must match the opening side (left drawers slide out left; right drawers slide out right).",
      "reason": "Header shows a right-side SheetContent, but the admin SheetContent side is truncated and there is no evidence of direction-aware close animations; direction correctness for both left and right drawers cannot be verified from the provided diff summary.",
